% Bucket Generator 
% Â© Trifecta Labs

% Creates the respective buckets from a schedule.
% A bucket is defined as a time period in a calendar
% that is free and available for an activity to be scheduled.

% Only considers free time between 6am and 9pm, and outside of
% normal working hours of 9am - 5pm.

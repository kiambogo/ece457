% The Simulated Annealing implementation of the training plan generator. 
% Performs an optimization on activities that constitute a training plan in an attempt to create the best training plan. 

% Takes a parameter of user_data which has the following format
% [Umax_distance Umax_climb]

% Takes a function obj which is the objective function

function plan = training_annealing(user_data, obj)
    
end
